  description: "Get Started with the TextMagic REST API\nTo start sending text messages\
    \ using the TextMagic REST API, just follow these steps:\n1. Generate the API\
    \ credentials\n1. Connect to our API endpoint\n\n## How to obtain the API credentials\n\
    To start sending text messages, you need to create an API key. An API key is similar\
    \ to an account password; the difference is that an API key only provides access\
    \ to the API; you cannot log in to TextMagic Online using the API key.\n\nYour\
    \ program\_sends the login credentials with each API request as HTTP headers:\
    \ **X-TM-Username** is your TextMagic username, while **X-TM-Key** is your API\
    \ key.\n\nAnother way is to send credentials using **BasicAuth** method. See [Basic\
    \ access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).\n\
    \nHow to obtain an API key:\n\n1.  [Log in](https://my.textmagic.com/login) to\
    \ TextMagic (or [start a free trial](https://my.textmagic.com/register/) if you\
    \ haven’t registered yet).\n2.  Go to the [API settings page](https://my.textmagic.com/online/api/rest-api/keys).\n\
    3.  Click the **Add new API key** button.\n4.  Enter an app name for this key.\
    \ Note, it’s just a label, so pick any name.\n5.  Click **Generate new key**.\n\
    6.  You should now see your new API key in the green notification banner above\
    \ the table:\n\n![alt text](images/credentials.png)\n\n> **Note for API v1 users**<br/>\n\
    V1 keys are not compatible with the V2 version of the TextMagic REST API, so you\
    \ will need to generate a new API key to use the V2 endpoint.\n\n\n## The API\
    \ endpoint\nThe TextMagic REST API endpoint is:\n```\nhttps://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2\n\
    ```\nAll the URLs referenced in this documentation should use this base URL.\n\
    \n## How the REST API works\nREST APIs use the HTTP protocol to send and receive\
    \ messages. REST messages are usually encoded as JSON documents and are an improvement\
    \ over \nolder methods such as the XML-based SOAP protocol. REST APIs use the\
    \ same set of methods that web browsers use: **POST, GET, PUT** or\_**DELETE**.\
    \ \nThese correspond to the CRUD operations **create, read, update** and **delete**.\
    \ Often, REST URIs provide direct CRUD access to entities or \ncollections of\
    \ entities, for example https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/lists. In this instance,\
    \ to delete a list’s endpoint, you might simply call the \nendpoint DELETE https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/lists/{id}.\
    \ REST makes these types of operations simple.\n\n> **Example**\n>\n> Let’s take\
    \ the entity most often used in messaging: contacts. Imagine you want to perform\
    \ operations on your contacts list: well, it’s only a matter of calling the following\
    \ endpoints:\n> *   **GET** /api/v2/contacts (get all of your contacts)\n> * \
    \  **GET** /api/v2/contacts/{id} (get a specific contact)\n> *   **POST** /api/v2/contacts\
    \ (create a new contact)\n> *   **PUT** /api/v2/contacts/{id} (update an existing\
    \ contact)\n> *   **DELETE** /api/v2/contacts/{id} (delete an existing contact)\n\
    It’s that simple! In fact, that’s all you need to do to manage the contacts in\
    \ your TextMagic account!"

    \ make requests using your TextMagic account, you need to enter your account `username`\
    \ and your `API key` into\nthe corresponding fields. To enter them, click the\
    \ **Authorize** button which you can find at the top-right corner of the page.\n\
    \nThe credentials modal window will be shown. Put your `username` and `API key`\
    \ in and press the **Authorize** button, as shown in the image below:\n\n<p style=\"\

    \ to test the TextMagic REST API directly from your browser. No programming skills\
    \ are required. To use Sandbox, simply click on the entry for the command you\
    \ want to test and then press on the \"Try it out\" button, which is underlined\
    \ in the image above.\n\nAs an example, let's look at a **create template** request:\n\
    \n<img srcset=\"images/sandbox_try_2_x1.png 1x, images/sandbox_try_2_x2.png 2x\"\
    >\n\nEnter the required parameters by editing the input JSON structure (just use\
    \ the provided example) and then click **Execute** to make a request. The URL\
    \ corresponds to the command you wish to use, e.g. `/api/v2/templates` corresponds\
    \ to the templates command.\n\nYou will receive an HTTP response code along with\
    \ a JSON response body showing whether the request was successful or not. You\
    \ will find additional information provided in the HTTP response headers **Response\
    \ Body** and the **Response Header** section.\n\n<img srcset=\"images/sandbox_try_3_x1.png\
    \ 1x, images/sandbox_try_3_x2.png 2x\">\n\nWe have now **successfully created**\
    \ a new message template and saved it to the TextMagic database. It was created\
    \ with an `ID` value of `631`. Now we can send a message using this template via\
    \ API or TextMagic Online.\n\nLet’s retrieve the template now to verify that its\
    \ content was saved correctly. To do this, use the GET `/api/v2/templates/{id}`\
    \ command. Open it, enter the **template id** you obtained in the previous step\
    \ and click **Execute**.\n\n<img srcset=\"images/sandbox_try_4_x1.png 1x, images/sandbox_try_4_x2.png\

  description: "The primary reason for using the TextMagic API is to send SMS text\
    \ messages. \n\n# Tutorials\n\n## How to send a single text message\n\nTo send\
    \ a simple text message to one recipient, you should set only the `text` and the\
    \ `phones` parameters. `text` should\ncontain that desired text and `phones` should\
    \ be set to the recipient’s international phone number.\n\nFor example, to send\
    \ an SMS message with the text “I love TextMagic” to the phone number +44 (0)\
    \ 7 860021130, use the command:\n\n> POST https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/messages\n\
    \nwith the following parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --------- | -----\
    \ |\n| text |I love TextMagic (don’t forget to urlencode your string!) |\n| phones\
    \ | 447860021130 |\n\nYou will receive a result like this:\n\n| Parameter | Example\
    \ |\n| --------- | ------- |\n| id | 49576009 |\n| href | /api/v2/messages/49576009\
    \ |\n| type | message |\n| sessionId | 34436600 |\n| bulkId | null |\n| messageId\
    \ | 49576009 |\n| scheduleId | null |\n\nAs long as you have sent a message to\
    \ at least one recipient, the TextMagic API will return not only the session ID,\n\
    but also the single message ID. Also, you can watch for the delivery status changes\
    \ using this ID without\nfetching session messages first. Since this is not a\
    \ bulk session or scheduled message,\n`bulkId` and `scheduleId` are null.\n\n\
    ## How to send bulk text messages\nYou can also send a message to many recipients\
    \ simultaneously. Let’s see how it’s done in the example below.\n\nAssuming that\
    \ you have a list ID 55314 (with 100 recipients), write:\n\n> POST https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/messages\n\
    \n| Parameter | Value |\n|-----------|-------|\n| **text** | `Hello, how are you?`\
    \ |\n| **lists** | `55314` |\n| **phones** | `447860021130,447860021131,447860021132,447860021134`\
    \ |\n| **contacts** | `318,395,3348015` |\n\nYou will receive a result like this:\n\
    \n|Parameter|Example|\n|---------|-------|\n|**id**|`357122`|\n|**href**|`/api/v2/sessions/357122`|\n\
    |**type**|`session`|\n|**sessionId**|`357122`|\n|**bulkId**|`null`|\n|**messageId**|`null`|\n\
    |**scheduleId**|`null`|\n\n## Sending more than 1,000 messages in one session\n\
    A **Bulk session** in TextMagic is when you send a message to more than 1,000\
    \ recipients. Since processing such a large session could take a long time (i.e.\
    \ more than a few seconds), the messages are stored in a queue temporarily. You\
    \ can check the progress of the messages by sending a **GET\_**to:\n> GET /api/v2/bulks/{id}\n\
    \nAssuming that you have list ID 55315 with more than 1,000 recipients, call:\n\
    \n> POST https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/messages\n\nwith the following parameters:\n\
    \n|Parameter|Value|\n|---------|-----|\n|**templateId**|`10541`|\n|**lists**|`55315`|\n\
    \nYou will receive a result like this:\n\n|Parameter|Example|\n|---------|-------|\n\
    |**id**|`357122`|\n|**href**|`/api/v2/bulks/357122`|\n|**type**|`bulk`|\n|**sessionId**|`null`|\n\
    |**bulkId**|`357122`|\n|**messageId**|`null`|\n|**scheduleId**|`null`|\n\nAs you\
    \ can see, the **session** has not been created yet; it will be created after\
    \ processing all the contacts you supplied during the request.\n\n## How to send\
    \ a text message using an SMS template\n\nNext, let’s try to send an SMS to a\
    \ contact list using a message template instead of specifying the message text.\
    \ An extra feature we can use is the\_[Custom fields](https://docs.textmagic.com/#tag/Custom-Fields)\
    \ tags, which we can apply to send personalized texts to all recipients.\n\nLet’\
    s assume that you have these items:\n\n*   a contact list with ID 10541 (with\
    \ two or more contacts) – you can use test number 999;\n*   the message template\
    \ with ID 55313 (with **First name** and **Last name** tags) – when you sign up\
    \ for a TextMagic account, you automatically receive several message templates,\
    \ such as **Callback request** or **Booking confirmation**, and you can use any\
    \ of them;\n*   a sufficient balance in your account to send this SMS message\
    \ to the contact list.\n\n> POST https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/messages\n\n\
    with the following parameters:\n\n|Parameter|Value|\n|---------|-----|\n|**templateId**|`10541`|\n\
    |**lists**|`55313`|\n\nYou will receive a result like this:\n\n|Parameter|Example|\n\
    |---------|-------|\n|**id**|`34436613`|\n|**href**|`/api/v2/sessions/34436613`|\n\
    |**type**|`session`|\n|**sessionId**|`34436613`|\n|**bulkId**|`null`|\n|**messageId**|`null`|\n\
    |**scheduleId**|`null`|\n\nThis is a sending session with more than one recipient\
    \ (but fewer than 1,000);\_see the notes above about sending bulk messages. We\
    \ cannot select just one message from this session, so the **messageId** is also\
    \ empty. However, you can\_[get the session for the messages](https://docs.textmagic.com/#tag/Outbound-Message-Sessions)\
    \ and then fetch the messages one by one.\n\n## How to send a text message with\
    \ an attachment\n\nText messages can include only text symbols. If you need to\
    \ send a PDF document or an image, you need to upload it to a cloud storage service\
    \ first and then insert a link to this document it into your text message. TextMagic\
    \ offers an Attachments feature which allows you to upload your document to the\
    \ TextMagic servers and get a relatively short download link. After that, you\
    \ just need to insert the link into your message text.\n\nTo upload an attachment,\
    \ use:\n\n> POST https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/messages/attachment\n\nwith\
    \ a single parameter:\n\n|Parameter|Value|Description|\n|---------|-----|-----------|\n\
    |**file**|`[multipart/form-data]`|Your request with attachment should be sent\
    \ in `multipart/form-data` format.**Note:** Only .jpg, .gif, .png, .pdf, .txt,\
    \ .csv, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx & .vcf attachment files up to 10\
    \ MB are supported.|\n\nYou will receive a result like this:\n\n|Parameter|Example|Description|\n\
    |---------|-------|-----------|\n|**href**|`click/Zwcj9`|This is a relative link\
    \ to your file. To construct a full link, just add “https://my.textmagic.com/”\
    \ to the beginning (like this: [https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9](https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9)).\
    \ For most modern devices, you can omit “https://” part and write just [my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9](https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9),\
    \ it will save you 8 characters.|\n|**chars**|`/api/v2/sessions/11`|`href` field\
    \ characters count.|**name**|`screen.png`|Original file name that will be displayed\
    \ on the download/preview page.|\n|**size**|`1094`|Attachment size in bytes.|\n\
    \nIt's as simple as that. Now you can send a text message with this link as described\
    \ above.\n\n# Delivery status callback\n\nA callback is a mechanism that posts\
    \ the JSON body of a sent message to the URL on a server that you specify. The\
    \ server application which receives the callback can check the message status\
    \ and trigger actions based on that data.\n\nHere is how to set up the delivery\
    \ status callback URL:\n\n1.  [Log in](https://my.textmagic.com/) to TextMagic\
    \ (or [start a free trial](https://my.textmagic.com/register/) if you haven’t\
    \ registered yet).\n2.  Go to the\_[API](https://my.textmagic.com/online/api/rest-api/keys)\
    \ page.\n3.  Enter your callback URL into the\_**Callback URL for delivery notifications**\
    \ field.\n4.  Click the\_**Test** button to test your URL.\n5.  If it’s successful,\
    \ click **Save changes**.\n\nYour server should reply with an **200 OK** response\
    \ at this URL. If it does not, your callback URL will be treated as invalid and\
    \ the inbound messages will not be passed to your application.\n\n### Call parameters\n\
    \nYour callback URL will be triggered immediately when the sent message status\
    \ changes. The parameters are passed by the **POST** method and contain the following\
    \ information (i.e. exact copy of the **message** resource plus custom **referenceId**,\
    \ if you have specified it when sending the message via **POST /api/v2/messages**).\

  description: "You can easily verify your customers using their phone numbers with\
    \ the help of 2FA (better known as two-factor authentication) and protect against\
    \ fraud, build trust, and increase conversions. There is a simple way to do this\
    \ with an API call to a TextMagic endpoint. With the help of TextMagic API, you\
    \ can:\n\n*   Send two-factor authentication messages (2FA);\n*   Send one-time\
    \ passwords (OTP);\n*   Integrate passwordless login into your app;\n*   Protect\
    \ your app from fraud.\n\n## How does it work?\n\n* **Step 1:** Your server makes\
    \ an API call to the TextMagic endpoint, and we send a text message (and later,\
    \ as a fallback, a generate a text-to-speech voice call) with a verification code\
    \ to the phone number supplied in the initial request.\n\n* **Step 2:** Once the\
    \ code is received, the user enters it into the relevant input field in your app.\
    \ This code needs to be passed to TextMagic in the second API call; if it is correct,\
    \ the server will respond with the correct response code. This way, you can ensure\
    \ that the recipient really owns the phone number entered into your app or form.\n\
    \n## Verification workflow\n\nTextMagic verification API sends a PIN code by text\
    \ message and follows up with two subsequent voice calls if the request wasn’\
    t completed or canceled. Below you will find the description of the default workflow.\n\
    \n1.  Send **a text message** with a verification code.\n2.  _Wait for 60 seconds._\n\
    3.  If the correct code was not supplied, send **the first text-to-speech**\_\
    voice call.\n4.  _Wait for 60 seconds._\n5.  If the code was not supplied, send\
    \ **the second text-to-speech**\_voice call.\n6.  _Wait for the verification._\
    \ The verification code is **valid for 5 minutes** from the time of the initial\
    \ request.\n\n> **Please note:**\_Submitting another verification request for\
    \ the same phone number before the original code has expired will result in a\
    \ 409 error code. The new verification request can be submitted only once the\
    \ previous code has expired (after 5 minutes) or canceled.\n"

  description: "When someone replies to an SMS you’ve sent via email to the SMS service,\
    \ the reply will be sent to the originating email address. This means that you\
    \ can simply reply to all incoming emails from the TextMagic service and the recipient\
    \ will receive the reply as an SMS.\n\n## How to set up incoming SMS alerts\n\n\
    To set up an incoming messages notification:\n\n1.  [Log in](https://my.textmagic.com/)\
    \ to TextMagic (or [start a free trial](https://my.textmagic.com/register/) if\
    \ you haven’t registered yet).\n2.  Go to [Incoming SMS alerts](https://my.textmagic.com/online/account/notifications/incoming).\n\
    3.  To turn on the receiving **SMS to Email** service, enable the\_**New incoming\
    \ SMS** option.\n4.  If you want the last ten messages from your conversation\
    \ included in the email reply, turn on the **Recent Chat History** feature.\n\n\
    > Normally, the reply is sent to the email address that started the conversation.\
    \ For example, if you sent an email from **charles@example.com** to [447971001234@textmagic.com](mailto:447971001234@textmagic.com)\_\
    and the recipient replied to that address, that reply will be sent to **charles@example.com**\
    \ by default. However, you can also nominate up to three additional email addresses\
    \ to receive a copy of that email. Add them into the **Forward incoming SMS to\
    \ email 1**, **2** or **3** fields.\n\n## Incoming SMS email alert (example)\n\
    \nWhen someone replies to a message you sent using\_**Email To SMS**, TextMagic\
    \ will forward the reply to your email.\n\n| Variable | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n\

    \ to one or even to hundreds of people and learn how to never miss another alert\
    \ or notification.\n\n## How distribution lists work\n\nAll emails sent to your\
    \ SMS distribution list email addresses will be immediately forwarded as text\
    \ messages to all the mobile phone numbers in that distribution list. You can\
    \ read more about distribution lists from our [marketing site](https://www.textmagic.com/sms-distribution-lists/)\
    \ or [help center](https://support.textmagic.com/article/how-to-forward-to-distribution-list-members-via-email-to-sms/).\n\
    \n## How to create a distribution list\n\nTo create a distribution list:\n\n1.\
    \  Go to [Distribution lists](https://my.textmagic.com/online/emailtosms/distribution-lists).\n\
    2.  Click **New distribution list**.\n3.  Give your list a name.\n4.  Add recipients\
    \ (phone numbers, contacts or lists).\n5.  Choose the content and message length\
    \ settings.\n6.  Choose what phone number will be sent with the messages. Click\
    \ here to learn more about [sender settings](https://support.textmagic.com/article/how-to-manage-sender-settings/).\n\
    7.  Click **Continue**.\n\nNow you can set up forwarding in your email application\
    \ or send emails to the distribution address.\n\n> Anyone who knows the email\
    \ address associated with your distribution list could send an email to it. This\
    \ could result in several messages being sent from your account. Therefore, it\
    \ is advised that you don’t use this email address for signing up an account or\
    \ share it with the public. Keep it secret.\n\n## Distribution list usage (example)\n\
    \nLet’s imagine we’ve created a distribution list `fe5436332432733@textmagic.com`\
    \ and have added `+447812345678`, `+447812345679`, `+447812345670` numbers as\
    \ recipients.  \n  \nIn order for all of them to receive the text message, we\
    \ send an email with following details:\n\n| Variable | Value |\n|-------|-------|\n\
    | From: | `your_email@yourdomain.com` |\n| To: | `fe5436332432733@textmagic.com`\
    \ |\n| Subject: | You can leave the subject blank. |\n| Body: |  `Server downtime\
    \ started 10:32:02 UTC. Please react ASAP.`|\n\nAs a result, all three recipients\
    \ will receive the text message and will be able to react quickly to fix the server\
    \ issue.\n\n> You can also include TextMagic contact **lists** and separate **contacts**\
    \ in the distribution list’s recipients field to avoid having to add numbers one\
    \ by one."

- name: "Encoding"
  description: "The text-message parameters should be encoded in the UTF-8 character\
    \ set. All non-ASCII characters in command parameters should be [encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).\
    \ The primary role of URL encoding is to encode URL strings into a form that can\
    \ be passed via email or scripted-web links without altering the actual content\
    \ in any way.\n\n## Supported character sets\n\n### GSM 03.38 encoding\n\nThe\
    \ standard SMS mobile-phone character set is used universally to send text messages.\
    \ You can send a longer text message by using only GSM 03.38 characters. The standard\
    \ character set allows up to 160 characters, and includes the Latin\_alphabet\
    \ and the most common accented forms, certain special characters, and the Greek\
    \ alphabet. It includes the following characters:\n\n<pre style='font-family:\
    \ Monaco,Monako,Menlo,Consolas,courier new,monospace!important'>\n@   Δ    SP\
    \   0    ¡    P    ¿    p\n£   _    !    1    A    Q    a    q\n$   Φ    \"  \

    \    D    T    d    t\né   Ω    %    5    E    U    e    u\nù   Π    &    6  \
    \  F    V    f    v\nì   Ψ    '    7    G    W    g    w\nò   Σ    (    8    H\
    \    X    h    x\nÇ   Θ    )    9    I    Y    i    y\nLF  Ξ    *    :    J  \

    \    l    ö\n</pre>\n\n**Note**: An escape character always precedes the characters\
    \ `{ } \\ ~ [ ] | ^ €`, which therefore takes two characters to send.\n\n### Unicode\n\
    \nWhen using non-GSM 03.38 characters, SMS transmits the message as a Unicode\
    \ message. Unicode character support also provides the capability to send a message\
    \ in Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Chinese and other alphabets.\n\n## Message length\n\
    \n### GSM 03.38 encoding\n\nSingle text messages are limited to 160 characters,\
    \ including spaces. However, to get around this restriction, messages can be linked\
    \ together (up to 6 parts) to form one long message.\n\nIn reality, each concatenated\
    \ text message is limited to 153 characters rather than 160 due to the need for\
    \ user-data header (UDH) information. This applies only to messages that contain\
    \ the standard GSM 03.38 character set. Mobile phones use UDH information to enable\
    \ them to link long messages together so that they appear as a single SMS message\
    \ in the recipients’ inboxes.\n\n| Number of SMSs | Total number of characters\
    \ in the linked message|\n|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n\
    | 1| 160|\n| 2| 306|\n| 3| 459|\n| 4| 612|\n| 5| 765|\n| 6| 918|\n\n### Unicode\n\
    \nUsing Unicode (for Russian, Arabic and Chinese languages) restricts messages\
    \ to a maximum of 70 characters per SMS. You can, however, send longer text messages\
    \ with our system by splitting them into two or at the most three separate text\
    \ messages. The table below gives the maximum lengths of two or more parts of\
    \ a concatenated Unicode text message.\n\n| Number of SMSs|Total number of characters\
    \ in the linked message|\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------|\n\

    Star textmagic/textmagic-rest-go-v2 on GitHub\">Star</a>\n\nThis library provides\
    \ you with an easy way of sending SMS and receiving replies by integrating TextMagic\
    \ SMS Gateway into your Go application.\n\n[Get it now on GitHub](https://github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-go-v2)\n\
    ## Installation\n\nWith go.mod:\n```bash\ngo get -u github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-go-v2/v2@v2.0.951\n\
    ```\n\nWithout go.mod:\n```bash\ngo get -u github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-go-v2\n\
    ```\n\n## Dependencies:\n\n- https://github.com/antihax/optional - this library\
    \ is used to provide optional argument types for API calls. See the `GetAllOutboundMessages`\
    \ call example below.\n\n## Usage Example\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\
    \    \"context\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"github.com/antihax/optional\"\n    // If\
    \ you're using go.mod use line below to import our module\n    // \ttm \"github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-go-v2/v2\"\
    \n    tm \"github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-go-v2\"\n    \"log\"\n)\n\nfunc\
    \ main() {\n\n    cfg := tm.NewConfiguration()\n    cfg.BasePath = \"https://rest.textmagic.com\"\
    \n    client := tm.NewAPIClient(cfg)\n\n    auth := context.WithValue(context.Background(),\
    \ tm.ContextBasicAuth, tm.BasicAuth{\n        UserName: \"YOUR_USERNAME\",\n \
    \       Password: \"YOUR_PASSWORD\",\n    })\n\n    // Simple ping request example\n\
    \    pingResponse, _, err := client.TextMagicApi.Ping(auth)\n\n    if err != nil\
    \ {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    } else {\n        fmt.Println(pingResponse.Ping)\n\
    \    }\n\n    // Send a new message request example\n    sendMessageResponse,\
    \ _, err := client.TextMagicApi.SendMessage(auth, tm.SendMessageInputObject{\n\
    \        Text: \"I love TextMagic!\",\n        Phones: \"+19998887766\",\n   \
    \ }, &tm.SendMessageOpts{})\n\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n \
    \   } else {\n        fmt.Println(sendMessageResponse.Id)\n    }\n\n    // Get\
    \ all outgoing messages request example\n    getAllOutboundMessageResponse, _,\
    \ err := client.TextMagicApi.GetAllOutboundMessages(auth, &tm.GetAllOutboundMessagesOpts{\n\
    \        Page: optional.NewInt32(1),\n        Limit: optional.NewInt32(250),\n\
    \    })\n\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    } else {\n       \
    \ fmt.Println(getAllOutboundMessageResponse.Resources[0].Id)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\
    ## Limitations\nDue to the issue at https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/7311,\
    \ the current version of Go SDK does not support any file uploading API calls.\n\
    \n# Delphi\n\n<a class=\"github-button\" href=\"https://github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-object-pascal\"\
    \ data-show-count=\"true\" aria-label=\"Star textmagic/textmagic-rest-object-pascal\
    \ on GitHub\">Star</a>\n\nThis library provides you with an easy way of sending\
    \ SMS and receiving replies by integrating TextMagic SMS Gateway into your Delphi\
    \ application.\n\n[Get it now on GitHub](https://github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-object-pascal)\n\
    \n## How to Install\nYou can clone the repo in your location of choice by using\
    \ :\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-object-pascal.git\n\
    ```\nYou can also manually clone the project, or simply download the files.\n\
    ## Getting it running\nYou'll need to make sure these 3 files are accessible by\
    \ your project, either by adding them directly to the project, or making them\
    \ accessible through your library path.\n- *TextmagicRestClient.pas* - The API\
    \ wrapper itself.\n- *XSuperJSON.pas* - Helper library for JSON Parsing\n- *XSuperObject.pas*\
    \ - Helper library for JSON Parsing\n\nOn your project you will only need to use\
    \ the unit *TextmagicRestClient.pas*.\n\nThe wrapper uses Indy components to communicate\
    \ with the REST API via SSL. In some cases, Indy will not be able to load the\
    \ SSL libraries. If that happens, you can get them at [https://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/].\
    \ You'll just need to make sure the files **libeay32.dll** and **ssleay32.dll**\
    \ (note: we use 32 bit versions for example application) are accessible to your\
    \ application.\n\nThat is all you need to start using the API.\n\n## Using the\
    \ API\nThe entire API is accessible via the class **TTMClient**, found in the\
    \ **TextmagicRestClient.pas** file. You'll need to provide your credentials when\
    \ creating the object. Check the TextMagic API documentation for up to date instructions\
    \ on how to do that.\n```Pascal\nvar TMC:TTMClient;\n...\nTMC := TTMClient.Create(Your_User_Name,\
    \ Your_API_V2_Key);\n```\nThe TTMClient's methods and parameters are very self-explanatory\
    \ and for the most part they correspond directly to the API functions. Keep in\
    \ mind most of the methods return an instance of a class, so don't forget to correctly\
    \ free them to avoid memory leaks.\nYou'll note several of the methods return\
    \ a **TTMLinkResult** class. This is a generic response for several of the API\
    \ functions and contains the **id** of the created/updated resource and a direct\
    \ link to the resource itself.\n## A few examples\nGetting your user account details\
    \ :\n```Pascal\nvar User:TTMUser;\n...\nUser:=TMC.GetUser;\nUser.free;\n```\n\
    Creating a new contact list:\n```Pascal\nvar LinkResult:TTMLinkResult;\n...\n\
    LinkResult:=TMC.CreateList('My new list');\n{ LinkResult.Id will contain the ID\
    \ of the newly created list } \nLinkResult.free;\n```\n\nCreating a new contact:\n\
    ```Pascal\nvar LinkResult:TTMLinkResult;\n...\n{ A list id is mandatory for creating\
    \ contacts }\nLinkResult:=TMC.CreateContact('99911111337', MY_LIST_ID,'John','Doe');\n\
    { LinkResult.Id will contain the ID of the newly created contact } \nLinkResult.free;\n\
    ```\nSending a message to a single contact:\n```Pascal\nvar MR:TTMMessageResult;\n\
    ...\nMR:=TMC.CreateMessage('My SMS message',null,null,MY_CONTACT_ID,null,null,null,null,null,null,null);\n\
    MR.free;\n```\nSending a message to a list of contacts:\n```Pascal\nvar MR:TTMMessageResult;\n\
    ...\nMR:=TMC.CreateMessage('My SMS message',null,null,null,MY_LIST_ID,null,null,null,null,null,null);\n\
    MR.free;\n```\n\n# Bash\n\n<a class=\"github-button\" href=\"https://github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-bash\"\
    \ data-show-count=\"true\" aria-label=\"Star textmagic/textmagic-rest-bash on\
    \ GitHub\">Star</a>\n\nThis library provides you with an easy way of sending SMS\
    \ and receiving replies by integrating TextMagic SMS Gateway into your Bash application.\n\
    \n[Get it now on GitHub](https://github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-bash)\n\n\
    ## Installation Instructions\n1.  [Download](https://github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-bash)\
    \ the latest version of the wrapper from GitHub.\n2.  Put **tm.sh** into any folder\
    \ or into PATH, if you want to use it globally.\n\n## Requirements\nThe Shell\
    \ wrapper for the TextMagic API has the following requirement:\n*   Bash version\
    \ 3 or newer.\n\n## Send SMS via Shell (an example)\nRun this in your command\
    \ prompt or execute in script:\n```bash\ntm.sh send --text=\"Hello from TextMagic\"\
    \ --phones=447860021130\n```\n\n"
