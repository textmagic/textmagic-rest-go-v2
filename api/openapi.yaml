    \ using the TextMagic REST API, just follow these steps:\n1. Generate the API\
    \ credentials\n1. Connect to our API endpoint\n\n## How to obtain the API credentials\n\
    To start sending text messages, you need to create an API key. An API key is similar\
    \ to an account password; the difference is that an API key only provides access\
    \ to the API; you cannot log in to TextMagic Online using the API key.\n\nYour\
    \ program\_sends the login credentials with each API request as HTTP headers:\
    \ **X-TM-Username** is your TextMagic username, while **X-TM-Key** is your API\
    \ key.\n\nAnother way is to send credentials using **BasicAuth** method. See [Basic\
    \ access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication).\n\
    \nHow to obtain an API key:\n\n1.  [Log in](https://my.textmagic.com/login) to\
    \ TextMagic (or [start a free trial](https://my.textmagic.com/register/) if you\
    \ haven’t registered yet).\n2.  Go to the [API settings page](https://my.textmagic.com/online/api/rest-api/keys).\n\
    3.  Click the **Add new API key** button.\n4.  Enter an app name for this key.\
    \ Note, it’s just a label, so pick any name.\n5.  Click **Generate new key**.\n\
    6.  You should now see your new API key in the green notification banner above\
    \ the table:\n\n![alt text](images/credentials.png)\n\n> **Note for API v1 users**<br/>\n\
    V1 keys are not compatible with the V2 version of the TextMagic REST API, so you\
    \ will need to generate a new API key to use the V2 endpoint.\n\n\n## The API\
    \ endpoint\nThe TextMagic REST API endpoint is:\n```\nhttps://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2\n\
    ```\nAll the URLs referenced in this documentation should use this base URL.\n\
    \n## How the REST API works\nREST APIs use the HTTP protocol to send and receive\
    \ messages. REST messages are usually encoded as JSON documents and are an improvement\
    \ over \nolder methods such as the XML-based SOAP protocol. REST APIs use the\
    \ same set of methods that web browsers use: **POST, GET, PUT** or\_**DELETE**.\
    \ \nThese correspond to the CRUD operations **create, read, update** and **delete**.\
    \ Often, REST URIs provide direct CRUD access to entities or \ncollections of\
    \ entities, for example https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/lists. In this instance,\
    \ to delete a list’s endpoint, you might simply call the \nendpoint DELETE https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/lists/{id}.\
    \ REST makes these types of operations simple.\n\n> **Example**\n>\n> Let’s take\
    \ the entity most often used in messaging: contacts. Imagine you want to perform\
    \ operations on your contacts list: well, it’s only a matter of calling the following\
    \ endpoints:\n> *   **GET** /api/v2/contacts (get all of your contacts)\n> * \
    \  **GET** /api/v2/contacts/{id} (get a specific contact)\n> *   **POST** /api/v2/contacts\
    \ (create a new contact)\n> *   **PUT** /api/v2/contacts/{id} (update an existing\
    \ contact)\n> *   **DELETE** /api/v2/contacts/{id} (delete an existing contact)\n\
    It’s that simple! In fact, that’s all you need to do to manage the contacts in\
    \ your TextMagic account!"

    \ a new message template and saved it to the TextMagic database. It was created\
    \ with an `ID` value of `631`. Now we can send a message using this template via\
    \ API or TextMagic Online.\n\nLet’s retrieve the template now to verify that its\
    \ content was saved correctly. To do this, use the GET `/api/v2/templates/{id}`\
    \ command. Open it, enter the **template id** you obtained in the previous step\
    \ and click **Execute**.\n\n<img srcset=\"images/sandbox_try_4_x1.png 1x, images/sandbox_try_4_x2.png\

    The primary reason for using the TextMagic API is to send SMS text messages.

    # Tutorials

    ## How to send a single text message

    To send a simple text message to one recipient, you should set only the `text` and the `phones` parameters. `text` should
    contain that desired text and `phones` should be set to the recipient’s international phone number.

    For example, to send an SMS message with the text “I love TextMagic” to the phone number +44 (0) 7 860021130, use the command:

    > POST https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/messages

    with the following parameters:

    | Parameter | Value |
    | --------- | ----- |
    | text |I love TextMagic (don’t forget to urlencode your string!) |
    | phones | 447860021130 |

    You will receive a result like this:

    | Parameter | Example |
    | --------- | ------- |
    | id | 49576009 |
    | href | /api/v2/messages/49576009 |
    | type | message |
    | sessionId | 34436600 |
    | bulkId | null |
    | messageId | 49576009 |
    | scheduleId | null |

    As long as you have sent a message to at least one recipient, the TextMagic API will return not only the session ID,
    but also the single message ID. Also, you can watch for the delivery status changes using this ID without
    fetching session messages first. Since this is not a bulk session or scheduled message,
    `bulkId` and `scheduleId` are null.

    ## How to send bulk text messages
    You can also send a message to many recipients simultaneously. Let’s see how it’s done in the example below.

    Assuming that you have a list ID 55314 (with 100 recipients), write:

    > POST https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/messages

    | Parameter | Value |
    |-----------|-------|
    | **text** | `Hello, how are you?` |
    | **lists** | `55314` |
    | **phones** | `447860021130,447860021131,447860021132,447860021134` |
    | **contacts** | `318,395,3348015` |

    You will receive a result like this:

    |Parameter|Example|
    |---------|-------|
    |**id**|`357122`|
    |**href**|`/api/v2/sessions/357122`|
    |**type**|`session`|
    |**sessionId**|`357122`|
    |**bulkId**|`null`|
    |**messageId**|`null`|
    |**scheduleId**|`null`|

    ## Sending more than 1,000 messages in one session
    A **Bulk session** in TextMagic is when you send a message to more than 1,000 recipients. Since processing such a large session could take a long time (i.e. more than a few seconds), the messages are stored in a queue temporarily. You can check the progress of the messages by sending a **GET **to:
    > GET /api/v2/bulks/{id}

    Assuming that you have list ID 55315 with more than 1,000 recipients, call:

    > POST https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/messages

    with the following parameters:

    |Parameter|Value|
    |---------|-----|
    |**templateId**|`10541`|
    |**lists**|`55315`|

    You will receive a result like this:

    |Parameter|Example|
    |---------|-------|
    |**id**|`357122`|
    |**href**|`/api/v2/bulks/357122`|
    |**type**|`bulk`|
    |**sessionId**|`null`|
    |**bulkId**|`357122`|
    |**messageId**|`null`|
    |**scheduleId**|`null`|

    As you can see, the **session** has not been created yet; it will be created after processing all the contacts you supplied during the request.

    ## How to send a text message using an SMS template

    Next, let’s try to send an SMS to a contact list using a message template instead of specifying the message text. An extra feature we can use is the [Custom fields](https://docs.textmagic.com/#tag/Custom-Fields) dynamic fields, which we can apply to send personalized texts to all recipients.

    Let’s assume that you have these items:

    *   a contact list with ID 10541 (with two or more contacts) – you can use test number 999;
    *   the message template with ID 55313 (with **First name** and **Last name** dynamic fields) – when you sign up for a TextMagic account, you automatically receive several message templates, such as **Callback request** or **Booking confirmation**, and you can use any of them;
    *   a sufficient balance in your account to send this SMS message to the contact list.

    > POST https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/messages

    with the following parameters:

    |Parameter|Value|
    |---------|-----|
    |**templateId**|`10541`|
    |**lists**|`55313`|

    You will receive a result like this:

    |Parameter|Example|
    |---------|-------|
    |**id**|`34436613`|
    |**href**|`/api/v2/sessions/34436613`|
    |**type**|`session`|
    |**sessionId**|`34436613`|
    |**bulkId**|`null`|
    |**messageId**|`null`|
    |**scheduleId**|`null`|

    This is a sending session with more than one recipient (but fewer than 1,000); see the notes above about sending bulk messages. We cannot select just one message from this session, so the **messageId** is also empty. However, you can [get the session for the messages](https://docs.textmagic.com/#tag/Outbound-Message-Sessions) and then fetch the messages one by one.

    ## How to send a text message with an attachment

    Text messages can include only text symbols. If you need to send a PDF document or an image, you need to upload it to a cloud storage service first and then insert a link to this document it into your text message. TextMagic offers an Attachments feature which allows you to upload your document to the TextMagic servers and get a relatively short download link. After that, you just need to insert the link into your message text.

    To upload an attachment, use:

    > POST https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/messages/attachment

    with a single parameter:

    |Parameter|Value|Description|
    |---------|-----|-----------|
    |**file**|`[multipart/form-data]`|Your request with attachment should be sent in `multipart/form-data` format.**Note:** Only .jpg, .gif, .png, .pdf, .txt, .csv, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx & .vcf attachment files up to 10 MB are supported.|

    You will receive a result like this:

    |Parameter|Example|Description|
    |---------|-------|-----------|
    |**href**|`click/Zwcj9`|This is a relative link to your file. To construct a full link, just add “https://my.textmagic.com/” to the beginning (like this: [https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9](https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9)). For most modern devices, you can omit “https://” part and write just [my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9](https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9), it will save you 8 characters.|
    |**chars**|`/api/v2/sessions/11`|`href` field characters count.|**name**|`screen.png`|Original file name that will be displayed on the download/preview page.|
    |**size**|`1094`|Attachment size in bytes.|

    It's as simple as that. Now you can send a text message with this link as described above.

    ## How to send a MMS message

    Text messages can include only text symbols. TextMagic offers an MMS feature that allows you to upload your document or picture to the TextMagic servers and get a short resource name to use it. To send MMS you just need to pass the resource name into special param in sending request [see more](https://docs.textmagic.com/#operation/sendMessage).

    To upload an mms attachment, use:

    > POST https://rest.textmagic.com/api/v2/messages/mms/attachment

    with a single parameter:

    |Parameter|Value|Description|
    |---------|-----|-----------|
    |**file**|`[multipart/form-data]`|Your request with attachment should be sent in `multipart/form-data` format.**Note:** Only .jpg, .gif, .png, .pdf, .txt, .csv, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx & .vcf attachment files up to 10 MB are supported.|

    You will receive a result like this:

    |Parameter|Example|Description|
    |---------|-------|-----------|
    |**href**|`click/Zwcj9`|This is a relative link to your file. To construct a full link, just add “https://my.textmagic.com/” to the beginning (like this: [https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9](https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9)). For most modern devices, you can omit “https://” part and write just [my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9](https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9), it will save you 8 characters.|
    |**chars**|`/api/v2/sessions/11`|`href` field characters count.|**name**|`screen.png`|Original file name that will be displayed on the download/preview page.|
    |**size**|`1094`|Attachment size in bytes.|
    |**resource**|`dasgfdsgdfdfgdfgdf.jpeg`|Internal file name will use in message sending request [see more](https://docs.textmagic.com/#operation/sendMessage).

    It's as simple as that. Now you can send an MMS message.

    # Delivery status callback

    A callback is a mechanism that posts the JSON body of a sent message to the URL on a server that you specify. The server application which receives the callback can check the message status and trigger actions based on that data.

    Delivery status callback is triggered when SMS receives a final status. This is a complete list of final statuses:
    * **d** - delivered;
    * **f** - failed;
    * **j** - rejected;
    * **u** - unknown.

    Here is how to set up the delivery status callback URL:

    1.  [Log in](https://my.textmagic.com/) to TextMagic (or [start a free trial](https://my.textmagic.com/register/) if you haven’t registered yet).
    2.  Go to the [API](https://my.textmagic.com/online/api/rest-api/keys) page.
    3.  Enter your callback URL into the **Callback URL for delivery notifications** field.
    4.  Click the **Test** button to test your URL.
    5.  If it’s successful, click **Save changes**.

    Your server should reply with an **200 OK** response at this URL. If it does not, your callback URL will be treated as invalid and the inbound messages will not be passed to your application.

    ### Call parameters

    Your callback URL will be triggered immediately when the sent message status changes. The parameters are passed by the **POST** method and contain the following information (i.e. exact copy of the **message** resource plus custom **referenceId**, if you have specified it when sending the message via **POST /api/v2/messages**). The Resource format is basically the format of the reply when making the request to the specific API resource.

    # Delivery status codes

    Below you’ll find several delivery statuses for sent messages, which are divided into two types:
    *   **intermediate** – temporary statuses that can change as the messages are processed;
    *   **final** – these statuses that are final and will not change.

    | Delivery status | Type                                                               | Description                                                                            |

    With the TextMagic API, you can establish a full two-way communication pipeline for sending and receiving text messages within your application.

    ## Incoming messages callback

    A callback is a mechanism that posts the JSON body of a received message to the URL on a server that you specify. The server application which receives the callback
    can save the message data into a database, send user notifications, etc.

    Here is how to set up the incoming messages callback URL:

    1.  [Log in](https://my.textmagic.com/) to TextMagic (or [start a free trial](https://my.textmagic.com/register/) if you haven’t registered yet).
    2.  Go to the [API](https://my.textmagic.com/online/api/settings) page.
    3.  Enter your callback URL into the **Callback URL for incoming messages** field.
    4.  Click the **Test** button to test your URL.
    5.  If it’s successful, click **Save changes**.

    Your server should reply with an **200 OK** response at this URL. If it does not, your callback URL will be treated as invalid and the inbound messages will not be passed to
    your application.

    ### Call parameters

    Your callback URL will be triggered immediately after a message reaches the TextMagic server. The parameters are passed by the **POST** method and contain the following
    information (i.e. an exact copy of the **reply** resource). The Resource format is basically the format of the reply when making the request to the specific API resource.

    | Parameter | Example | Description |
    | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
    | **id**    | `1782832`| Inbound message ID. |
    | **sender** | `447860021130` | Sender phone number. |
    | **receiver** | `447624800500` | Receiver phone number (i.e. **your** dedicated or shared reply number). |
    | **messageTime** | `2012-11-28T18:38:28+0000` | The time when the message reached the TextMagic server. |
    | **text** | `Test reply` | Inbound message text. |

    # Tags API

    The Tags API allows you to create and manage tags for organizing and categorizing your contacts in the TextMagic platform. Tags provide a flexible way to segment your contact database.

    ## Key Features

    - **Contact Organization**: Categorize contacts with custom tags for better organization
    - **Flexible Segmentation**: Create unlimited tags to segment your contact database
    - **Custom Categorization**: Define your own tag names to match your business needs
    - **Multi-tag Support**: Apply multiple tags to a single contact for complex segmentation

    ## Tag Management

    ### Creating Tags
    Create new tags with descriptive names to categorize your contacts. Tag names must be unique within your account and can be up to 50 characters long.

    ### Applying Tags to Contacts
    Once created, tags can be assigned to contacts individually or in bulk. A single contact can have multiple tags for flexible organization.

    ## Getting Started

    1. Create tags using the Create Tag endpoint with descriptive names
    2. Apply tags to your contacts through the contact management endpoints
    3. Use tags to filter and target contacts
    4. Monitor and manage your tags through the Tags API endpoints

    For detailed endpoint documentation, see the individual endpoint descriptions below.
  name: Tags

    You can easily verify your customers using their phone numbers with the help of 2FA (better known as two-factor authentication) and protect against fraud, build trust, and increase conversions. There is a simple way to do this with an API call to a TextMagic endpoint. With the help of TextMagic API, you can:

    *   Send two-factor authentication messages (2FA);
    *   Send one-time passwords (OTP);
    *   Integrate passwordless login into your app;
    *   Protect your app from fraud.

    ## How does it work?

    * **Step 1:** Your server makes an API call to the TextMagic endpoint, and we send a text message (and later, as a fallback, a generate a text-to-speech voice call) with a verification code to the phone number supplied in the initial request.

    * **Step 2:** Once the code is received, the user enters it into the relevant input field in your app. This code needs to be passed to TextMagic in the second API call; if it is correct, the server will respond with the correct response code. This way, you can ensure that the recipient really owns the phone number entered into your app or form.

    ## Verification workflow

    TextMagic verification API sends a PIN code by text messages or voice calls. Below you will find the description of the default workflow.

    1.  Send **a text message** with a verification code.
    2.  _Wait for 60 seconds._
    3.  If the correct code was not supplied, send **the first text-to-speech** voice call.
    4.  _Wait for 60 seconds._
    5.  If the code was not supplied, send **the second text-to-speech** voice call.
    6.  _Wait for the verification._ The verification code is **valid for 5 minutes** from the time of the initial request.

    > **Please note:** Submitting another verification request for the same phone number before the original code has expired will result in a 409 error code. The new verification request can be submitted only once the previous code has expired (after 5 minutes) or canceled.

    ## Custom fields list (Merge dynamic fields)

    All dynamic fields should be inputted inside curly braces (e.g., `{First name}` for **First name**).

    | Dynamic field | Description |
    |---------------|-------------|
    | **First name** | Contact first name. |

    When someone replies to an SMS you’ve sent via email to the SMS service, the reply will be sent to the originating email address. This means that you can simply reply to all incoming emails from the TextMagic service and the recipient will receive the reply as an SMS.

    ## How to set up incoming SMS alerts

    To set up an incoming messages notification:

    1.  [Log in](https://my.textmagic.com/) to TextMagic (or [start a free trial](https://my.textmagic.com/register/) if you haven’t registered yet).
    2.  Go to [Incoming SMS alerts](https://my.textmagic.com/online/account/notifications/incoming).
    3.  To turn on the receiving **SMS to Email** service, enable the **New incoming SMS** option.
    4.  If you want the last ten messages from your conversation included in the email reply, turn on the **Recent Chat History** feature.

    > Normally, the reply is sent to the email address that started the conversation. For example, if you sent an email from **charles@example.com** to [447971001234@textmagic.com](mailto:447971001234@textmagic.com) and the recipient replied to that address, that reply will be sent to **charles@example.com** by default. However, you can also nominate up to three additional email addresses to receive a copy of that email. Add them into the **Forward incoming SMS to email 1**, **2** or **3** fields.

    ## Incoming SMS email alert (example)

    When someone replies to a message you sent using **Email To SMS**, TextMagic will forward the reply to your email.

- description: "All of the possible response codes you can get from the TextMagic\
    \ API are described on this page.\n\n## HTTP response codes\n\nWhen you make a\
    \ request to the TextMagic REST API, you will receive a response that represents\
    \ the new or modified object state (when you use\_**GET**/ **POST**/ **PUT**\_\
    methods) or a success message (when you\_**DELETE** a\_resource). But if something\
    \ goes wrong, instead of **20x,**\_you will get a different status code. Here\
    \ are all the possible response codes:\n\n| Code | Explanation|\n|------|-----------\
    \ |\n| 200 OK| Common OK status code. Request was successful.|\n| 201 Created|\
    \ A resource has been created or updated successfully.|\n| 202 Accepted| Request\
    \ accepted and is being processed.|\n| 204 No content| Resource deleted successfully.|\n\
    | 302 Found| Redirect. Your code should follow the address specified in the\_\
    **Location**\_header.|\n| 400 Bad request| Invalid parameters specified: some\
    \ required parameters are missing or malformed. Check the corresponding command\
    \ documentation.|\n| 401 Unauthorized| Current user has no rights to perform the\
    \ specified action. For example, regular users cannot view [Invoices](https://docs.textmagic.com/#tag/Billing)\
    \ or [Sub-Accounts](#tag/User-Subaccounts).|\n| 404 Not found| Resource not found.|\n\
    | 429 Too many requests| Request limit reached. Please try again later.| \n| 500\
    \ Internal server error| Internal server error has occurred. Please try again\
    \ later.|\n| 503 Service unavailable | Service is unavailable due to maintenance.|\n\
    \n## Error responses\nIn case of an error, the TextMagic API responds with one\
    \ of the HTTP error codes (4xx-5xx as shown below) and returns these common error\
    \ responses.\n<SchemaDefinition schemaRef=\"#/components/schemas/BadRequestResponse\"\
    \ />\n\n## Link responses\nWhen you create or update some resource (via\_ **POST**\
    \ and\_ **PUT\_**requests) you will get a link response:\n\n<SchemaDefinition\
    \ schemaRef=\"#/components/schemas/ResourceLinkResponse\" />\n\n## Delete responses\n\
    When you delete something, a delete response will be returned. The response body\
    \ will be empty and the HTTP code will show\_**204 No Content**."

    The TextMagic SMS API has only one restriction and two limitations. Learn more about them below.

    ## Number format restriction
    You must use the [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) phone number format during the API request as no local phone formats are accepted (i.e. use **447045678945** instead of **070 4567 8945**). This restriction has been applied to ensure delivery to the desired number without any accidental local-to-international phone transformations.

    ## Maximum “limit” parameter value
    Commands that return an array of resources (e.g. GET /api/v2/messages) can take the **limit** parameter, which can be between `1` and `100`, otherwise it will be replaced with the default value of `10`.

    ## API request frequency limit
    You may not execute more than **50 requests per second**. If you do, a `429 Too Many Requests` error will be returned. Please note that you can use contacts, lists and templates for [sending multiple messages](/docs/api/send-sms/#send-bulk-text-messages) simultaneously per request.

    **However, the following endpoints are subject to stricter rate limits of 5 requests per second**:

    - `DELETE /api/v2/contacts/blocked`
    - `PUT /api/v2/contacts/{id}`
    - `PUT /api/v2/lists/{id}/contacts`
    - `POST /api/v2/lists/{id}/contacts`

    Please ensure your integration respects these limits to avoid service disruptions.

    The text-message parameters should be encoded in the UTF-8 character set. All non-ASCII characters in command parameters should be [encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding). The primary role of URL encoding is to encode URL strings into a form that can be passed via email or scripted-web links without altering the actual content in any way.

    ## Supported character sets

    ### GSM 03.38 encoding

    The standard SMS mobile-phone character set is used universally to send text messages. You can send a longer text message by using only GSM 03.38 characters. The standard character set allows up to 160 characters, and includes the Latin alphabet and the most common accented forms, certain special characters, and the Greek alphabet. It includes the following characters:

    <pre style='font-family: Monaco,Monako,Menlo,Consolas,courier new,monospace!important'>
    @   Δ    SP   0    ¡    P    ¿    p
    £   _    !    1    A    Q    a    q
    $   Φ    "    2    B    R    b    r
    ¥   Γ    #    3    C    S    c    s
    è   Λ    ¤    4    D    T    d    t
    é   Ω    %    5    E    U    e    u
    ù   Π    &    6    F    V    f    v
    ì   Ψ    '    7    G    W    g    w
    ò   Σ    (    8    H    X    h    x
    Ç   Θ    )    9    I    Y    i    y
    LF  Ξ    *    :    J    Z    j    z
    Ø   ESC  +    ;    K    Ä    k    ä
    ø   Æ    ,    <    L    Ö    l    ö
    </pre>

    **Note**: An escape character always precedes the characters `{ } \ ~ [ ] | ^ €`, which therefore takes two characters to send.

    ### Unicode

    When using non-GSM 03.38 characters, SMS transmits the message as a Unicode message. Unicode character support also provides the capability to send a message in Arabic, Japanese, Russian, Chinese and other alphabets.

    ## Message length

    ### GSM 03.38 encoding

    Single text messages are limited to 160 characters, including spaces. However, to get around this restriction, messages can be linked together (up to 6 parts) to form one long message.

    In reality, each concatenated text message is limited to 153 characters rather than 160 due to the need for user-data header (UDH) information. This applies only to messages that contain the standard GSM 03.38 character set. Mobile phones use UDH information to enable them to link long messages together so that they appear as a single SMS message in the recipients’ inboxes.

    | Number of SMSs | Total number of characters in the linked message|
    |----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
    | 1| 160|
    | 2| 306|
    | 3| 459|
    | 4| 612|
    | 5| 765|
    | 6| 918|

    ### Unicode

    Using Unicode (for Russian, Arabic and Chinese languages) restricts messages to a maximum of 70 characters per SMS. You can, however, send longer text messages with our system by splitting them into two or at the most three separate text messages. The table below gives the maximum lengths of two or more parts of a concatenated Unicode text message.

    | Number of SMSs|Total number of characters in the linked message|
    |---------------|------------------------------------------------|
    |1|70|
    |2|134|
    |3|201|
    |4|268|

    ```\n\n## Development\n\nThis SDK uses **Babel** to transpile modern ES6+ code\
    \ to CommonJS for maximum compatibility.\n\n### Build Process\n\nThe SDK source\
    \ code is written in ES6+ (located in `src/`) and is automatically transpiled\
    \ to ES5/CommonJS (in `dist/`) during installation:\n\n```bash\nnpm install  #\
    \ Automatically runs: npm run build\n```\n\n### Manual Build\n\nIf you need to\
    \ rebuild the SDK manually:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis will transpile\
    \ all files from `src/` to `dist/` using Babel.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Basic\
    \ Usage\n\n```javascript\nconst TextMagicClient = require('textmagic-client');\n\
    \n// Get your credentials from: https://app.textmagic.com/settings/api\nconst\
    \ defaultClient = TextMagicClient.ApiClient.instance;\nconst BasicAuth = defaultClient.authentications['BasicAuth'];\n\
    \nBasicAuth.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME';\nBasicAuth.password = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\n\
    \nconst api = new TextMagicClient.TextMagicApi();\n\n// Test connection\napi.ping()\n\
    \  .then(data => {\n    console.log('Ping successful:', data.ping);\n  })\n  .catch(error\
    \ => {\n    console.error('API Error:', error);\n  });\n```\n\n### Using async/await\
    \ (Modern Approach)\n\n```javascript\nconst TextMagicClient = require('textmagic-client');\n\
    \nasync function main() {\n  const defaultClient = TextMagicClient.ApiClient.instance;\n\
    \  const BasicAuth = defaultClient.authentications['BasicAuth'];\n\n  BasicAuth.username\
    \ = 'YOUR_USERNAME';\n  BasicAuth.password = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\n\n  const api =\
    \ new TextMagicClient.TextMagicApi();\n\n  try {\n    // Test connection\n   \
    \ const pingResult = await api.ping();\n    console.log('Ping successful:', pingResult.ping);\n\
    \  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('API Error:', error);\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n\
    ```\n\n### Sending Messages\n\n```javascript\nconst TextMagicClient = require('textmagic-client');\n\
    \nasync function sendMessage() {\n  const defaultClient = TextMagicClient.ApiClient.instance;\n\
    \  const BasicAuth = defaultClient.authentications['BasicAuth'];\n\n  BasicAuth.username\
    \ = 'YOUR_USERNAME';\n  BasicAuth.password = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\n\n  const api =\
    \ new TextMagicClient.TextMagicApi();\n\n  const sendMessageRequest = new TextMagicClient.SendMessageRequest();\n\
    \  sendMessageRequest.text = 'Hello from TextMagic Node.js SDK!';\n  sendMessageRequest.phones\
    \ = '+19993322111,+19993322110';\n\n  try {\n    const result = await api.sendMessage(sendMessageRequest);\n\
    \    console.log('Message sent! Session ID:', result.id);\n  } catch (error) {\n\
    \    console.error('Failed to send message:', error);\n  }\n}\n\nsendMessage();\n\
    ```\n\n### Getting Outgoing Messages\n\n```javascript\nconst TextMagicClient =\
    \ require('textmagic-client');\n\nasync function getMessages() {\n  const defaultClient\
    \ = TextMagicClient.ApiClient.instance;\n  const BasicAuth = defaultClient.authentications['BasicAuth'];\n\
    \n  BasicAuth.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME';\n  BasicAuth.password = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\n\
    \n  const api = new TextMagicClient.TextMagicApi();\n\n  try {\n    const result\
    \ = await api.getAllOutboundMessages(1, 10);\n\n    result.resources.forEach(message\
    \ => {\n      console.log('Message ID:', message.id);\n      console.log('Text:',\
    \ message.text);\n      console.log('Status:', message.status);\n      console.log('---');\n\
    \    });\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error:', error);\n  }\n}\n\n\
    getMessages();\n```\n\n### Uploading Files\n\n```javascript\nconst TextMagicClient\
    \ = require('textmagic-client');\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nasync function\
    \ uploadAvatar() {\n  const defaultClient = TextMagicClient.ApiClient.instance;\n\
    \  const BasicAuth = defaultClient.authentications['BasicAuth'];\n\n  BasicAuth.username\
    \ = 'YOUR_USERNAME';\n  BasicAuth.password = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\n\n  const api =\
    \ new TextMagicClient.TextMagicApi();\n\n  try {\n    const fileStream = fs.createReadStream('avatar.jpg');\n\
    \    const result = await api.uploadListAvatar(fileStream, 3223); // 3223 is sample\
    \ list ID\n    console.log('Avatar uploaded successfully!');\n  } catch (error)\
    \ {\n    console.error('Upload failed:', error);\n  }\n}\n\nuploadAvatar();\n\
    ```\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe SDK uses Promises and can throw errors that should\
    \ be properly handled:\n\n```javascript\nconst TextMagicClient = require('textmagic-client');\n\
    \nasync function handleErrors() {\n  const defaultClient = TextMagicClient.ApiClient.instance;\n\
    \  const BasicAuth = defaultClient.authentications['BasicAuth'];\n\n  BasicAuth.username\
    \ = 'YOUR_USERNAME';\n  BasicAuth.password = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\n\n  const api =\
    \ new TextMagicClient.TextMagicApi();\n\n  try {\n    const result = await api.sendMessage({\n\
    \      text: 'Test message',\n      phones: '+1234567890'\n    });\n    console.log('Success:',\
    \ result);\n  } catch (error) {\n    // Handle different types of errors\n   \
    \ if (error.response) {\n      // API returned an error response\n      console.error('API\
    \ Error:', error.response.status);\n      console.error('Error details:', error.response.body);\n\
    \    } else if (error.request) {\n      // Request was made but no response received\n\
    \      console.error('Network Error:', error.message);\n    } else {\n      //\
    \ Something else went wrong\n      console.error('Error:', error.message);\n \
    \   }\n  }\n}\n\nhandleErrors();\n```\n\n### Common Error Codes\n\n- **401 Unauthorized**\
    \ - Invalid credentials\n- **400 Bad Request** - Invalid parameters\n- **404 Not\
    \ Found** - Resource not found\n- **429 Too Many Requests** - Rate limit exceeded\n\
    - **500 Internal Server Error** - Server error\n\n## API Documentation\n\nFor\

    \ Changes\n\n#### Node.js Version Requirement\n\n**v2.x:**\n```json\n\"node\"\
    : \">=6.0.0\"\n```\n\n**v3.x:**\n```json\n\"node\": \">=18.0.0\"\n```\n\n**Action\
    \ Required:** Upgrade your Node.js version to 18.0.0 or later.\n\n```bash\n# Check\
    \ your Node.js version\nnode -v\n\n# Should output: v18.x.x or higher\n```\n\n\
    #### Dependencies Update\n\n**v2.x:**\n```json\n\"superagent\": \"^3.5.2\"\n```\n\
    \n**v3.x:**\n```json\n\"superagent\": \"^10.2.2\",\n\"@babel/cli\": \"^7.24.0\"\
    \n```\n\n**Note:**\n- Superagent 10.x includes modern features, better TypeScript\
    \ support, and security improvements.\n- Babel is now used to transpile ES6+ code\
    \ to CommonJS for maximum compatibility.\n\n### What Stays the Same\n\n✅ **Module\
    \ structure** - No changes required:\n```javascript\nconst TextMagicClient = require('textmagic-client');\n\
    const api = new TextMagicClient.TextMagicApi();\n```\n\n✅ **Authentication** -\
    \ Configuration remains the same:\n```javascript\nconst BasicAuth = defaultClient.authentications['BasicAuth'];\n\
    BasicAuth.username = 'YOUR_USERNAME';\nBasicAuth.password = 'YOUR_API_KEY';\n\
    ```\n\n✅ **API Methods** - All methods remain the same:\n```javascript\napi.sendMessage(request);\n\
    api.getAllOutboundMessages(page, limit);\napi.getContact(id);\n// ... all other\
    \ methods unchanged\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Migration\n\n1. **Upgrade Node.js\
    \ to 18.0.0+**\n   ```bash\n   # Using nvm (recommended)\n   nvm install 18\n\
    \   nvm use 18\n\n   # Verify\n   node -v\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Package Dependencies**\n\
    \   ```bash\n   # Update to latest version\n   npm install textmagic-client@latest\
    \ --save\n\n   # Or update all dependencies\n   npm update\n   ```\n\n3. **Update\
    \ Your Code to Use async/await (Recommended)**\n\n   **Before (v2.x):**\n   ```javascript\n\
    \   api.ping().then(function(data) {\n     console.log(data.ping);\n   }).catch(function(err)\
    \ {\n     console.error(err);\n   });\n   ```\n\n   **After (v3.x):**\n   ```javascript\n\
    \   try {\n     const data = await api.ping();\n     console.log(data.ping);\n\
    \   } catch (error) {\n     console.error(error);\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Test Your\
    \ Application**\n   ```bash\n   # Run your tests\n   npm test\n\n   # Or test\
    \ manually\n   node your_script.js\n   ```\n\n### Compatibility Matrix\n\n|  \
    \  Feature    | v2.x | v3.x | Compatible? |\n|---------------|------|------|-------------|\n\
    | Node.js 6-16  |  ✅  |  ❌  |    ❌ No    |\n| Node.js 18+   |  ✅  |  ✅  |    ✅\
    \ Yes   |\n| API Methods   | Same | Same |    ✅ Yes   |\n| Models        | Same\
    \ | Same |    ✅ Yes   |\n| Authentication| Same | Same |    ✅ Yes   |\n| Promises\
    \      |  ✅  |  ✅  |    ✅ Yes   |\n| async/await   |  ✅  |  ✅  |    ✅ Yes   |\n\

    \nThis library provides you with an easy way of sending SMS and receiving replies\
    \ by integrating TextMagic SMS Gateway into your Java application.\n\n[Get it\
    \ now on GitHub](https://github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-java-v2)\n\n\n##\
    \ Requirements\n\n1. Java 11+\n2. Maven/Gradle\n\n## Migration Guide from v2.x\
    \ to v3.x\n\nVersion 3.0 introduces several breaking changes to improve performance,\
    \ security, and maintainability. Please review this guide carefully before upgrading.\n\
    \n### Breaking Changes\n\n#### 1. Java Version Requirement\n\n**Old (v2.x):**\n\
    - Minimum Java version: 1.7+\n\n**New (v3.x):**\n- Minimum Java version: 11+\n\
    \n**Action Required:**\n```xml\n<!-- Update your pom.xml -->\n<properties>\n \
    \   <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>\n    <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>\n\
    </properties>\n```\n\n#### 2. Date/Time Types\n\n**Old (v2.x):**\n```java\nimport\
    \ java.util.Date;\n\nDate createdAt = message.getCreatedAt();\n```\n\n**New (v3.x):**\n\
    ```java\nimport java.time.OffsetDateTime;\n\nOffsetDateTime createdAt = message.getCreatedAt();\n\
    ```\n\n**Action Required:**\n- Replace all `java.util.Date` with `java.time.OffsetDateTime`\n\
    - Update date formatting logic:\n  ```java\n  // Old\n  SimpleDateFormat sdf =\
    \ new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd\");\n  String date = sdf.format(createdAt);\n\
    \n  // New\n  DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd\"\
    );\n  String date = createdAt.format(formatter);\n  ```\n\n#### 3. HTTP Client\
    \ Library\n\n**Old (v2.x):**\n- OkHttp 2.7.5\n\n**New (v3.x):**\n- OkHttp 4.12.0\n\
    \n**Action Required:**\n- If you use custom OkHttp interceptors, update to OkHttp\
    \ 4.x API:\n  ```java\n  // Old (v2.x)\n  client.interceptors().add(new Interceptor()\
    \ {\n      @Override\n      public Response intercept(Chain chain) throws IOException\
    \ {\n          // ...\n      }\n  });\n\n  // New (v3.x)\n  client.addInterceptor(new\
    \ Interceptor() {\n      @NotNull\n      @Override\n      public Response intercept(@NotNull\
    \ Chain chain) throws IOException {\n          // ...\n      }\n  });\n\n####\
    \ 4. Model Name Changes\n\n**Old (v2.x):**\n```java\nimport com.textmagic.sdk.model.ContactList;\n\
    import com.textmagic.sdk.model.MessageFile;\n\nContactList list = api.getList(123);\n\
    MessageFile file = api.getFile(456);\n```\n\n**New (v3.x):**\n```java\nimport\
    \ com.textmagic.sdk.model.ModelList;\nimport com.textmagic.sdk.model.ModelFile;\n\
    \nModelList list = api.getList(123);\nModelFile file = api.getFile(456);\n```\n\
    \n**Action Required:**\n- Replace `ContactList` → `ModelList` in all imports and\
    \ type declarations\n- Replace `MessageFile` → `ModelFile` in all imports and\
    \ type declarations\n- Use IDE's \"Find and Replace\" feature:\n  ```\n  Find:\
    \ import com.textmagic.sdk.model.ContactList;\n  Replace: import com.textmagic.sdk.model.ModelList;\n\
    \n  Find: import com.textmagic.sdk.model.MessageFile;\n  Replace: import com.textmagic.sdk.model.ModelFile;\n\
    \n  Find: ContactList\n  Replace: ModelList\n\n  Find: MessageFile\n  Replace:\
    \ ModelFile\n  ```\n\n**Why this change?**\n- v2.x used custom names (`ContactList`,\
    \ `MessageFile`) via preprocessing script\n- v3.x uses OpenAPI Generator's standard\
    \ naming convention with `Model` prefix\n- This aligns with industry best practices\
    \ and improves consistency\n\n#### 5. Dependencies\n\n**Updated dependencies:**\n\
    - `com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp` 2.7.5 → 4.12.0\n- `com.google.code.gson:gson`\
    \ 2.8.x → 2.10.1\n- `org.apache.commons:commons-lang3` 3.x → 3.18.0\n\n**Action\
    \ Required:**\n- Review your dependency tree for conflicts:\n  ```bash\n  mvn\
    \ dependency:tree\n  ```\n- Update any conflicting dependencies in your project\n\
    \n### Migration Steps\n\n1. **Update Java version to 11+**\n   ```bash\n   java\
    \ -version  # Verify Java 11 or higher\n   ```\n\n2. **Update SDK version in pom.xml**\n\
    \   ```xml\n   <dependency>\n       <groupId>com.textmagic.sdk</groupId>\n   \
    \    <artifactId>textmagic-java-sdk</artifactId>\n       <version>3.0.43863</version>\n\
    \   </dependency>\n   ```\n\n3. **Update imports**\n   - Replace `java.util.Date`\
    \ → `java.time.OffsetDateTime`\n   - Replace `java.util.Calendar` → `java.time.ZonedDateTime`\n\
    \   - Replace `com.textmagic.sdk.model.ContactList` → `com.textmagic.sdk.model.ModelList`\n\
    \   - Replace `com.textmagic.sdk.model.MessageFile` → `com.textmagic.sdk.model.ModelFile`\n\
    \n4. **Update date/time handling**\n   - Review all date parsing and formatting\
    \ code\n   - Use `java.time` API instead of `SimpleDateFormat`\n\n5. **Update\
    \ model references**\n   - Search and replace `ContactList` → `ModelList`\n  \
    \ - Search and replace `MessageFile` → `ModelFile`\n   - Recommended: Use IDE's\
    \ \"Find in Path\" with scope limited to your code\n\n6. **Test thoroughly**\n\
    \   - Run your test suite\n   - Pay special attention to date/time operations\n\
    \   - Verify file upload functionality\n\n### Common Issues\n\n#### Issue: `java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError`\n\
    \n**Cause:** Your project is compiled with Java < 11\n\n**Solution:**\n```xml\n\
    <properties>\n    <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>\n    <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>\n\
    </properties>\n```\n\n#### Issue: `cannot find symbol: class Date`\n\n**Cause:**\
    \ Missing import after migration\n\n**Solution:**\n```java\n// Remove\nimport\
    \ java.util.Date;\n\n// Add\nimport java.time.OffsetDateTime;\n```\n\n#### Issue:\
    \ OkHttp compatibility errors\n\n**Cause:** Conflicting OkHttp versions in classpath\n\
    \n**Solution:**\n```xml\n<!-- Exclude old OkHttp from other dependencies -->\n\
    <dependency>\n    <groupId>some.other.library</groupId>\n    <artifactId>library</artifactId>\n\
    \    <version>1.0.0</version>\n    <exclusions>\n        <exclusion>\n       \
    \     <groupId>com.squareup.okhttp</groupId>\n            <artifactId>okhttp</artifactId>\n\
    \        </exclusion>\n    </exclusions>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n#### Issue: `cannot\
    \ find symbol: class ContactList` or `cannot find symbol: class MessageFile`\n\
    \n**Cause:** Model names changed from `ContactList`/`MessageFile` to `ModelList`/`ModelFile`\n\
    \n**Solution:**\n```java\n// Old (v2.x)\nimport com.textmagic.sdk.model.ContactList;\n\
    ContactList myList = api.getList(123);\n\n// New (v3.x)\nimport com.textmagic.sdk.model.ModelList;\n\
    ModelList myList = api.getList(123);\n```\n\n**Quick fix with sed (Unix/Mac):**\n\
    ```bash\n# Backup your files first!\nfind . -name \"*.java\" -type f -exec sed\
    \ -i.bak 's/import com\\.textmagic\\.sdk\\.model\\.ContactList;/import com.textmagic.sdk.model.ModelList;/g'\
    \ {} \\;\nfind . -name \"*.java\" -type f -exec sed -i.bak 's/import com\\.textmagic\\\
    .sdk\\.model\\.MessageFile;/import com.textmagic.sdk.model.ModelFile;/g' {} \\\
    ;\nfind . -name \"*.java\" -type f -exec sed -i.bak 's/\\bContactList\\b/ModelList/g'\
    \ {} \\;\nfind . -name \"*.java\" -type f -exec sed -i.bak 's/\\bMessageFile\\\
    b/ModelFile/g' {} \\;\n```\n\n### Need Help?\n\nIf you encounter issues during\

    ## How to Install\nYou can clone the repo in your location of choice by using\
    \ :\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/textmagic/textmagic-rest-object-pascal.git\n\
    ```\nYou can also manually clone the project, or simply download the files.\n\
    ## Getting it running\nYou'll need to make sure these 3 files are accessible by\
    \ your project, either by adding them directly to the project, or making them\
    \ accessible through your library path.\n- *TextmagicRestClient.pas* - The API\
    \ wrapper itself.\n- *XSuperJSON.pas* - Helper library for JSON Parsing\n- *XSuperObject.pas*\
    \ - Helper library for JSON Parsing\n\nOn your project you will only need to use\
    \ the unit *TextmagicRestClient.pas*.\n\nThe wrapper uses Indy components to communicate\
    \ with the REST API via SSL. In some cases, Indy will not be able to load the\
    \ SSL libraries. If that happens, you can get them at [https://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/].\
    \ You'll just need to make sure the files **libeay32.dll** and **ssleay32.dll**\
    \ (note: we use 32 bit versions for example application) are accessible to your\
    \ application.\n\nThat is all you need to start using the API.\n\n## Using the\
    \ API\nThe entire API is accessible via the class **TTMClient**, found in the\
    \ **TextmagicRestClient.pas** file. You'll need to provide your credentials when\
    \ creating the object. Check the TextMagic API documentation for up to date instructions\
    \ on how to do that.\n```Pascal\nvar TMC:TTMClient;\n...\nTMC := TTMClient.Create(Your_User_Name,\
    \ Your_API_V2_Key);\n```\nThe TTMClient's methods and parameters are very self-explanatory\
    \ and for the most part they correspond directly to the API functions. Keep in\
    \ mind most of the methods return an instance of a class, so don't forget to correctly\
    \ free them to avoid memory leaks.\nYou'll note several of the methods return\
    \ a **TTMLinkResult** class. This is a generic response for several of the API\
    \ functions and contains the **id** of the created/updated resource and a direct\
    \ link to the resource itself.\n## A few examples\nGetting your user account details\
    \ :\n```Pascal\nvar User:TTMUser;\n...\nUser:=TMC.GetUser;\nUser.free;\n```\n\
    Creating a new contact list:\n```Pascal\nvar LinkResult:TTMLinkResult;\n...\n\

    # Email Campaign API

    The Email Campaign API allows you to create and manage email marketing campaigns through the TextMagic platform. This API provides functionality to send immediate and scheduled bulk emails to your contacts and groups with advanced tracking and analytics.

    ## Key Features

    - **Immediate Email Sending**: Send emails to multiple recipients right away
    - **Scheduled Campaigns**: Schedule emails for future delivery with one-time or recurring schedules
    - **Contact Integration**: Send to existing contacts, groups, or direct email addresses
    - **Email Sender Management**: Configure and manage verified email sender addresses
    - **Custom Sender Settings**: Use your configured email sender IDs for branded communications
    - **Advanced Tracking**: Monitor delivery, opens, clicks, and other engagement metrics
    - **Cost Management**: Real-time cost calculation and balance validation
    - **Team Collaboration**: Support for team workflows and impersonation
    - **Recurring Campaigns**: Set up automated email sequences with flexible scheduling

    ## Authentication

    All Email Campaign API endpoints require authentication using your TextMagic API credentials. Include your authentication token in the request headers.

    ## Rate Limits

    Email campaigns are subject to rate limiting and sending quotas based on your account plan. Monitor your usage through the API responses and account dashboard.

    ## Supported Recipients

    You can send email campaigns to:
    - **Contacts**: Use contact IDs from your TextMagic contact list
    - **Groups**: Target entire contact groups by group ID
    - **Direct Emails**: Send to specific email addresses not in your contact list
    - **Mixed Recipients**: Combine contacts, groups, and direct emails in a single campaign

    ## Cost Calculation

    Email campaign costs are calculated based on:
    - Number of recipients
    - Your account's email pricing tier
    - Additional features used (tracking, analytics, etc.)

    The API will validate your account balance before creating campaigns and return cost estimates in responses.

    ## Error Handling

    The API returns detailed error information for common scenarios:
    - Insufficient account balance
    - Invalid recipient data
    - Missing or invalid sender configuration
    - Validation errors in campaign content

    ## Campaign Types

    ### Immediate Campaigns
    Send emails immediately to your recipients. Perfect for:
    - Breaking news and urgent announcements
    - Time-sensitive promotions
    - One-off communications

    ### Scheduled Campaigns
    Schedule emails for future delivery with flexible timing options:
    - **One-time scheduled**: Send at a specific date and time
    - **Recurring campaigns**: Automated sending with daily, weekly, monthly, or custom schedules
    - **Timezone support**: Schedule in recipient's local timezone or specific timezone

    ## Getting Started

    ### Email Sender Setup
    1. Configure your email sender settings and verify your domains in your TextMagic account
    2. Use the Get Email Senders endpoint to retrieve available verified senders
    3. Note the sender IDs for use in campaign creation

    ### For Immediate Campaigns
    1. Get your verified email senders using the Email Senders endpoint
    2. Prepare your recipient lists (contacts, groups, or email addresses)
    3. Create your email content with subject and HTML message
    4. Use the Create Email Campaign endpoint with a verified sender ID to send immediately
    5. Monitor campaign progress and analytics through the response data

    ### For Scheduled Campaigns
    1. Get your verified email senders using the Email Senders endpoint
    2. Prepare your recipient lists (contacts, groups, or email addresses)
    3. Create your email content with subject and HTML message
    4. Define your schedule parameters (date, time, timezone, recurrence rules)
    5. Use the Schedule Email Campaign endpoint with a verified sender ID
    6. Monitor scheduled campaigns and their execution through the API

    For detailed endpoint documentation, see the individual endpoint descriptions below.

      description: "Creates a new email campaign and sends it to the specified recipients.\n\
        \nThis endpoint allows you to create and immediately send an email marketing\
        \ campaign to your contacts, groups, or direct email addresses. The campaign\
        \ will be processed asynchronously, and you'll receive a campaign object with\
        \ tracking information.\n\n## Request Requirements\n\n- **Email Sender ID**:\
        \ Must be a valid, configured email sender from your account\n- **Recipients**:\
        \ At least one recipient type must be specified (contacts, groups, or emails)\n\
        - **Content**: Subject and HTML message content are required\n- **Balance**:\
        \ Sufficient account balance for the estimated campaign cost\n\n## Recipient\
        \ Types\n\nYou can target multiple recipient types in a single campaign:\n\
        \n- **Contact IDs**: Send to specific contacts from your contact list\n- **Group\
        \ IDs**: Send to all contacts within specified groups  \n- **Direct Emails**:\
        \ Send to email addresses not in your contact list\n\n## Content Guidelines\n\
        \n- **Subject**: Maximum 998 characters, should be engaging and relevant\n\
        - **Message**: HTML content supported, including images, links, and formatting\n\
        - **From Name**: Optional custom sender name (max 500 characters)\n- **Reply-To**:\
        \ Optional custom reply-to email address\n\n## Cost and Balance\n\nThe API\
        \ automatically calculates campaign costs based on:\n- Total number of unique\
        \ recipients across all specified groups, contacts, and emails\n- Your account's\
        \ email pricing tier\n- Any additional features or premium content\n\nIf your\
        \ account balance is insufficient, the request will be rejected with a low\
        \ balance error.\n\n## Response Information\n\nSuccessful campaigns return:\n\
        - Campaign ID for tracking and analytics\n- Current campaign status and progress\n\
        - Cost breakdown and recipient counts\n- Sender information and content preview\n\
        - Statistical totals and engagement metrics\n\n## Error Scenarios\n\nCommon\
        \ error conditions include:\n- **Validation Errors**: Invalid email addresses,\
        \ missing required fields, or content that exceeds limits\n- **Insufficient\
        \ Balance**: Account balance too low for campaign cost\n- **Invalid Recipients**:\
        \ Non-existent contact/group IDs or invalid email formats\n- **Sender Configuration**:\
        \ Invalid or unconfigured email sender ID\n- **No Recipients**: All recipient\
        \ arrays are empty or invalid\n"

  /api/v2/tags:
    post:
      description: |
        Creates a new tag for organizing and categorizing contacts.

        This endpoint allows you to create a custom tag that can be used to segment and organize your contact database. Tags provide a flexible way to categorize contacts for better contact management.

        ## Request Requirements

        - **Title**: Required field, must be between 1 and 50 characters
        - **Uniqueness**: Tag titles must be unique within your account
        - **Authentication**: Valid API credentials required

        ## Common Use Cases

        Create tags for various organizational purposes:

        - **Customer Types**: "VIP Customer", "New Lead", "Active Subscriber"
        - **Geographic Segments**: "North Region", "Europe", "Local Customers"
        - **Engagement Levels**: "Highly Engaged", "Inactive", "Recent Purchase"
        - **Campaign Categories**: "Summer Promotion", "Newsletter Subscriber", "Event Attendee"
        - **Custom Segments**: Any custom categorization that fits your business needs

        ## Response Information

        Successful tag creation returns:
        - **Tag ID**: Unique identifier for the newly created tag
        - **Title**: The tag name as provided in the request

        Use the returned tag ID to assign this tag to contacts or reference it in other API operations.

        ## Error Scenarios

        Common error conditions include:
        - **Validation Errors**: Title exceeds 50 characters or is empty
        - **Duplicate Tag**: A tag with the same title already exists in your account
        - **Authentication Errors**: Invalid or missing API credentials

        ## Next Steps

        After creating a tag:
        1. Use the tag ID to assign it to contacts via contact management endpoints
        2. Reference the tag when filtering contacts
        3. Manage and update tags through other Tags API endpoints

            This is a relative link to your file. To construct a full link, just add “[https://my.textmagic.com/”](https://my.textmagic.com/%E2%80%9D) to the beginning (like this: [https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9](https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9)). For most modern devices, you can omit the “https://” part and write just [my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9](https://my.textmagic.com/click/Zwcj9), which will save you 8 characters.
